# 🐸 Jonathan // aka Croakster

Welcome to my GitHub — part code lab, part digital swamp. Here you’ll find my programming projects, and *Croakster*-infused commentary on tech, power, and the human condition.

## 🔧 About Me

I'm a self-taught programmer currently exploring:
- **Python** (beginner projects, Wordle clones, and more)
- **Web Dev** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **C# + Unity** (coming soon: interactive Croakster games)
- **Git/GitHub** (version control, collaboration, and public transparency)

I’m also building out content for *The CroakCast*, a YouTube/podcast hybrid featuring a clever, charismatic frog who takes on Big Tech, free speech, and AI ethics with my satire and swampy wisdom.


## 🎙️ The CroakCast

> *“When the system gets murky, Croakster speaks up. Loud.”*

🌀 Topics I create videos on:
- systemic justice
- Trendy news
- Gen AI
- How to's on programming
- Satire + tech ethics

## 🧠 Philosophy

Code isn’t neutral. Neither is content. I aim to build tools and stories that question assumptions, hold systems accountable, and entertain without dumbing down.
